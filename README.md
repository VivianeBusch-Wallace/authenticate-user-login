# authenticate-user-login

This is a simple user login app.

I have a welcome page, allow the user to login or register and I authenticate the user by checking if he is in my database.

If the user is not in my database he has to sign up using the registration form.

When the user logged in successfully he is greeted by username.

Tools used:

- handlebars (templating engine)
- cookie-parser and express-session (cookies and sessions are saved in the database)
- express
- mongoose (for our database in MongoDB)
- others
